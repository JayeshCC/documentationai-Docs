## Document Organization and Folders

Organize your documentation hierarchically to keep projects manageable. Create folders for categories like API references, user guides, or release notes. Nest subfolders for deeper structure, such as `guides/quickstart` or `api/v1/endpoints`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root. Click the `{New Folder}` button and enter a name like `Project Docs`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Documents" icon="file-text">
    Inside the folder, select `{New Document}`. Choose `{Markdown}` or `{Plain Text}` format.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rearrange" icon="move">
    Drag and drop folders or files to reorder or nest them dynamically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use descriptive names like `v2.0-release-notes` for easy navigation.

## Collaboration and Sharing Options

Invite team members to view, comment, or edit documents. Set granular permissions per folder or document.

| Option | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| View Only | Read access without edits | Public docs, client previews |
| Commenter | Add notes and suggestions | Review cycles |
| Editor | Full modify access | Team contributions |
| Admin | Manage permissions and folders | Project leads |

Share via public links or embed codes. Generate a link with expiration for temporary access.

<Expandable title="Advanced Permissions" default-open="false">
  Assign roles at folder level to inherit down the hierarchy. Use `{api.example.com/docs/YOUR_KEY/share}` for programmatic sharing.
</Expandable>

## Search Functionality and Links

Search across all documents with full-text indexing. Enter keywords like "authentication" to find matches in titles, content, or code blocks. Filter by folder or date.

Internal links connect sections seamlessly. Use `[Link Text](/path/to/doc#section)` for navigation.

```markdown
[Go to Features](/features#editing-tools)
```
